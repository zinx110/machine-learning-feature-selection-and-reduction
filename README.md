# Machine Learning Feature Selection and Feature Reduction and Prediction Model
University Machine Learning course - Mid term project. It includes the code implementation of feature selection, feature reduction and prediction model, as long as a short powerpoint presentation on it. 
I used aniime.csv dataset and tried to predict the score of an anime based on the other features.
